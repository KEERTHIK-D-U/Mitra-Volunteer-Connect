## About the Project

**Mitra Volunteer Connect** is a web-based platform designed to bring communities together by connecting passionate volunteers with meaningful projects that require their skills and expertise.

## Vision

Our vision is to leverage technology to create a seamless volunteer matching system that benefits both community organizations and individuals eager to make a difference.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: PHP

> **Note**: AI-powered matching functionality is planned for future releases but is not yet implemented.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KEERTHIK-D-U/Mitra-Volunteer-Connect.git
   ```

2. **Set Up a Local Server**

   Since the project uses PHP, you'll need a local server environment. You can use tools like:

   - [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)
   - [WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com/en/)
   - [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/)

   After setting up, place the cloned repository in the server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).

3. **Run the Project**

   Start your local server and navigate to:

   ```
   http://localhost/Mitra-Volunteer-Connect
   ```

   This will launch the application in your web browser.
